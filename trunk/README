This set of scricpts are derived from the gNewSense Builder scripts. We 
are or will be changinging it deeply. For example we are using Debian to build off of. 
We will remove the Gnome Dekstop Environment and replace that with the MATE
Environment Desktop the KDE will also be replaced with something lighter.
The "NON-FREE" parts will stay, as far as is needed and or used.

This set of scripts is to create your own GNU/Linux distribution based on Ubuntu,
including a livecd and repositories. It removes the non-free elements of
Ubuntu. These scripts are currently used to create the gNewSense distribution.

The syslinux directory and much of gen-livecd was taken from the debian-live project, and subsequently modified. The ubiquity.png is from the ubiquity source package, with the Ubuntu logo removed via the GIMP.

These scripts are released under the GPLv2 or later.
