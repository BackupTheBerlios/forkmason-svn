openoffice.org-fix for Debian
-----------------------------

By default OpenOffice.org contains a URL in its extensions dialog that
points to a list of extensions that includes non-free ones. The Free
Software Foundation created a list that includes only free extensions.
This package makes OpenOffice.org point to the FSF list.
