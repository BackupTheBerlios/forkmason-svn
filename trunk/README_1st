I am changing the build method somewhat, so we have 3 build scripts ==> ForkMason - does the MAIN repo, ForkMasonMM - does the MULTIMEDIA repo, and ForkMasonSEC - does the SECURITY repo.

These will only pull the Debian archive and rebuild it for your devopment release ( I like calling it that ).

Then use rebuildd to rebuild the packages, your own packages to the 'incoming' folder.

There will be a new set of howto use these scripts.
